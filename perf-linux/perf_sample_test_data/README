This directory contains six test files, and the results of running
perf on these test files.  We provide these files for two reasons.

First, it provides smaple files in the format perf expects to see as
input.  This is only important if you will use perf during your
development.  Note that the format of the files you must submit
includes an extra column -- the unique case ID for each case (each
line).

The second use of the files is to verify that perf on your machine
generates similar output.  Below are the commands used to run perf to
create the results files.

Some of the file names have the word "bad" at the beginning.  These
are files that contain predictions that do not conform to what perf
wants to see for some of the metrics.  For example, "-cxe"
(cross-entropy) and "-slq 0.01" (slac q-score) both expect predictions
to be on the interval [0-1] and have trouble with numbers outside this
range.  We include these files and the output perf generates for them
because a common mistake is to not convert the predictions from your
model to this range for these metrics.  For example, SVM predictions
often are [-inf,+inf] and this will not work with metrics such as
cross entropy and slq.

CAREFUL: To prevent overwriting the results files by runing these
commands with the output redirected, we've placed a 'z' at the end
of the output file names.

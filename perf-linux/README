Perf Release 5.11: July 3, 2004

A minor bug was fixed in the way ties are dealt with in the APR code.
In some instances, the number of cases in a tie was miscalculated by
1, leading to incorrect results.  This only effected result where more
than 2 cases were given the same prediction.

Thanks.


Perf Release 5.10: July 8, 2004

A bug was found in how perf calculates Aaverage precision (APR) when
there is only one true positive in the data set (or block) given to
perf.  Perf 5.00, the version originally released for the KDD-CUP,
always returned APR = 0.0 when there was only one true positive.

This has been fixed in this new release.  This gave us an opportunity
to revise how perf calculates APR.  The new method not only fixes the
bug with the previous code for APR, but is a new way of defining
average precision that we think represents an improvement to the
metric.  This improvement should make optimizing to the metric easier,
and the results more meaningful.

APR is only used for the BIO problem, so this only affects the protein
matching problem.  The change in APR when there are many true
positives should be small.

We also took the opportunity to make a few minor improvements to error
reporting in perf.  Perf now has additional warning messages when the
data set contains only all positive or only all negative instances.

Thanks.
